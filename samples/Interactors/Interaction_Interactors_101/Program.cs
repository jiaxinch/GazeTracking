    /// Interactor is a region on the screen for which some gaze based behavior is defined.
    /// Most common behaviors the Tobii Core SDK is exposing for interactors is gaze aware
    /// (simply a notion of whether somebody is looking at the region or not), activatable
    /// (which means region has some action associated with it, which can be triggered, but
    /// only if someone is looking at it at the same time), pannable (provides panning like
    /// behavior with associated actions, which can be triggered, but again only if someone
    /// is looking at it at the same time). 
    /// 
    /// To help you manage interactors, the Tobii Core SDK provides another concept - InteractorAgents.
    /// When you do not work with WPF or WindowsForms, the Tobii Core SDK has UnboundInteractorAgent,
    /// which you can use to control everything related to interactors.
    /// 
    /// Gaze aware is the most basic behavior we could think of, so let's see how its easy to
    /// define 'you are looking at it' interactor with the Tobii Core SDK.
