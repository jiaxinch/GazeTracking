    /// <summary>
    /// Interactor is a region on screen for which some gaze based behavior is defined.
    /// Most common behaviors the Tobii Core SDK is exposing for interactors is gaze aware
    /// (simply a notion of whether somebody is looking at the region or not), activatable
    /// (which means the region has some action associated with it, which can be triggered, but
    /// only if someone is looking at it at the same time), pannable (provides panning like
    /// behavior with associated actions, which can be triggered, but again only if someone
    /// is looking at it at the same time). 
    /// 
    /// To help you manage interactors, the Tobii Core SDK provides another concept - InteractorAgents.
    /// When you do not work with WPF or WindowsForms, the Tobii Core SDK has UnboundInteractorAgent,
    /// which you can use to control everything related to interactors.
    /// 
    /// Activatable interactor usually has some action associated with it. This action can be
    /// invoked using Commands, exposed through Commands property of the Host instance.
    /// Activatable interactors can also have Tentative Focus and/or an ActivationFocus action
    /// associated with them. Tentative focus behaves similary to GazeAware behavior, except
    /// that only one activatable interactor could have focus at any given moment of time, while
    /// any number of GazeAware interactors will have gaze if you are looking at them.
    /// Before activatable interactors can be activated you need to send a special command -
    /// ActivationModeOn. When that occurrs, instead of reporting Tentative focus when
    /// someone is looking at the activatable interactor, it will report ActivationFocus.
    /// Again, only one activatable interactor could have ActivationFocus at any given moment in time.
    /// 
    /// This sample demonstrates how to define an activatable interactor, how to associate different
    /// actions with it's states and how to activate it using Commands.
